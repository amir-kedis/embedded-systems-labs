# Static Positions:

- Holding the IMU in various orientations:

  - Flat
  - Tilted
  - Upside down
  - Vertical

- Hold each position for 3-5 seconds as this would establish a baseline for the IMU's bias

# Linear Movement:

- **Straight Lines**:

  - Move the IMU in a straight line in the X, Y, and Z directions separetely
  - Move the IMU in a straight line in the X, Y, and Z directions while rotating it about the X, Y, and Z axes

- **Back and forth**:

  - Move the IMU back and forth in the X, Y, and Z directions separetely
  - Move the IMU back and forth in the X, Y, and Z directions while rotating it about the X, Y, and Z axes

- **Grid Patterns**:

  - Try to move in rectangular path in each plane (XY, YZ, XZ)
  - Try to move in rectangular path in each plane while rotating the IMU about the X, Y, and Z axes

    > The rotations nature would be: Single axis rotations, combined axis rotations, complete rotations in different planes
